# Kubernetes 101 - Part 3: Managed deployments

In the previous part we created some objects manually using the command line.

## Levelling up

Whilst you could create files for all of your objects as Pods, Services, ReplicaSets etc. this could get a bit tedious over time. Inevitably you’ll want to reuse these files, template their values and share them with others.

For this, we’re going to use a popular tool called Helm.

We’re going to use Helm to deploy an application using a ‘chart’. First, let’s install Helm into your Kubernetes cluster:

    helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/

This installs the Helm server into your cluster. It’s called Tiller, because, well, boat stuff.

Now let’s use Helm to install Jenkins:

    helm install my-jenkins stable/jenkins

You can see the status of your installed releases with:

    helm list

Helm generates a unique release name for every chart you install. Normally you’d set this yourself.

Let’s see what Helm just did for us. We can inspect the chart and its values using:

    helm inspect all stable/jenkins

You can see all the work Helm does for us: it defines Kubernetes objects like services, deployments etc. You can customise these by editing the values file and passing it to Helm when you install the chart.

> Example showing the objects created:
> Run `helm status <release name>`
